	<h4>Lending</h4>

	<p>For lenders, the process begins by signing up for a free membership on our website. Once you've created your account, you can then browse listings of available loan opportunities, choosing one or more that you would like to fund. You make a bid for any portion of the loan (including proposing your own interest rate) and if the borrower accepts your bid, you're in business!</p>

	<p>The repayment of your loan occurs in weekly or monthly installments. As soon as the borrower makes a repayment, we credit the funds back to your lender account. The repaid funds can be withdrawn at any time, or you can reinvest the money in new loans to other borrowers.</p>
