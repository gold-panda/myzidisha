	<h1>Volunteer or Intern With Zidisha Microfinance</h1>
	<br/>

	<p>Zidisha volunteers and interns enjoy a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in microfinance and international development, while extending life-changing business growth opportunities to entrepreneurs in some of the the world\'s most disadvantaged locations.</p>

	<h4>Virtual Volunteer Team</h4>
	<p>Do you have a passion for advancing opportunities for highly motivated people in the world\'s poorest communities? Do you enjoy volunteering on a flexible schedule from the comfort of your own home?</p>
	<p>We have openings for volunteers who would like to contribute two or more hours per week to join our Virtual Volunteer team. Virtual Volunteers review applications for completeness, and assist borrowers who request help to interact with our website via email and SMS, and assist in translation of borrower content. This is a position that may be undertaken on a flexible schedule, from any location in the world with an internet connection.</p>
	<p>If you would like to learn more about joining our Virtual Volunteer Team, please send an email to <a href="mailto:service@zidisha.org">service@zidisha.org</a>.</p>

	<h4>Microfinance Internships</h4>
	<p>Zidisha offers full-time Client Relationship Manager internships in the countries in which we have lending programs.  Client Relationship Managers spend the majority of their time meeting with Zidisha entrepreneurs at their business locations and homes rather than doing office work.</p> 
	<p>In addition, we have openings for part-time Country Liaison Interns.  Country Liaison Interns may be based anywhere in the world, with flexible work hours to accommodate class or work schedules.  This position is focused on managing loan transactions and providing service to Zidisha borrowers.</p>
	<p>Finally, we welcome entrepreneurial individuals with expertise in a specific developing country to join us as New Country Expansion Coordinators.  This is also a virtual, part-time opportunity, for leaders who will assist us to launch new Zidisha lending services in your chosen country.</p>
	<p>Please follow the links below to view our current internship openings.</p>
