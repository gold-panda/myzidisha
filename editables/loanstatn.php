$lang['loanstatn']['tooltip_crncy_risk']='Under Zidisha\'s lending model, loan values are fixed in local currency upon disbursement, and the lenders assume currency risk. Exchange rates fluctuate and this can cause the US Dollar value of the loans to either increase or decrease during the course of the repayment period, leading to monetary gains or losses for lenders. Since exchange rate fluctuations often go both ways for multiple currencies during the same time period, spreading lending activity across multiple countries may help lenders hedge against currency risk.';
