<p><strong>What is microfinance?</strong></p>
<p>
Microfinance is the provision of financial services on a small scale to low-income individuals, mostly in developing countries.  Business loans, often under $1000, are the most common type of financial service offered by microfinance institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Why do low-income individuals in developing countries need loans?</strong></p>

<p>Since there is very little opportunity for formal employment in developing countries, most people earn a living by initiating their own revenue-generating activities: farming, rearing livestock, keeping small shops and restaurants, producing clothing, and so forth.  Like any business, these endeavors need capital, usually in large lump sums, in order to grow.  Microfinance loans offer households a chance to access the lump sums needed to purchase the assets - a high-yielding dairy cow, bulk purchase of materials, a sewing machine, etc. - that can increase production and incomes substantially.</p>  
<p><strong>Why do these individuals not save the necessary amounts, instead of borrowing?</strong></p>

<p>Though not impossible, it is exceedingly difficult for households in developing countries to save lump sums large enough to buy productive assets from their current earnings.  In the poorest parts of the world, customers typically pay for their purchases on credit, in tiny amounts, and these trickles of income are used first for family consumption needs, such as food, and medical care.  </p>
<p><strong>Why not provide an outright donation, instead of a loan?</strong></p>
<p>Many people do not wish to accept charity, and view a loan as a mutually beneficial alternative that is more dignified than a handout.  Providing capital as a loan that must be paid back helps ensure that it is used to build a business that will continue to generate income over the long term.    Finally, providing loans instead of donations better incentivizes the building of profitable, self-sufficient businesses.</p>
<p><strong>This sounds good in theory.  How well does microfinance work in practice?</strong></p>
<p>This question has been much debated recently.  Much of the debate is due to the difficulty of statistically “proving” that microfinance loans reduce poverty.  The problem with statistical studies is the standards for what constitutes “proof” can be set so high that they are very difficult to meet, even when the hypothesis one is testing is true.  (See the MyC4 blog post <a href="http://blog.myc4.com/2012/05/11/due-diligence-current-debates-on-microfinance/" target="_blank">Due Diligence - Current debates on Microfinance</a> for an excellent overview of this debate.)</p>

<p>The extent to which a microfinance loan improves incomes also depends on how the loan is priced.  High interest and fees can take a big cut out of microfinance clients’ profits, undermining the beneficial impact of the loan.</p>
<p><strong>What do microfinance loans typically cost for borrowers?</strong></p>

<p>Interest and fees charged by microfinance institutions vary widely, and may reach 100% or more of the loan amount at annual rates.  Though data on the global average cost of microfinance is scarce, interest and fee rates of 30% to 40% are typical.  The average interest and fee rate charged by microfinance organizations that fund loans through the popular microlending website Kiva is 35.21% (January 2010 figure, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_(organization)).</p>
