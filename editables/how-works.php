			<h4>Lending</h4>
			<p>For lenders, the process begins by signing up for a free membership on our website. Once you\'ve created your account, you can then browse listings of available loan opportunities, choosing one or more that you would like to fund. You make a bid for any portion of the loan (including proposing your own interest rate) and if the borrower accepts your bid, you are in business!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span8">
			<h4>Borrowing</h4>
			<p>The borrowing process begins by applying online here at Zidisha.org. As a potential borrower, you will be asked to provide background information on  your business and financial history. Once approved, you\'ll then be able to create a loan application on our website, describing your business and the purpose of the loan.</p>

			<h4>What Happens Next?</h4>
			<p>100% of your loan is disbursed directly to the borrower. The borrower can then post updates on Zidisha.org, letting you know how your loan is impacting his or her business. In addition, you can keep in contact with the borrower through our site and ask the borrower questions about the business. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="span8">
			<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
			<p>The repayment of your loan occurs in monthly installments. These monthly installments can be withdrawn at any time, or you can reinvest the money with new loans to additional borrowers.</p>

			<h4 class="type14">Important Legal Notice</h4>
			<p class="type10">Zidisha is a nonprofit organization engaged in the facilitation of microfinance lending to low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries. Zidisha\'s primary purpose is to provide financial aid in the form of loans. Zidisha believes that its lending model fosters a sense of responsibility and success for borrowers who repay their loans. The principal purpose of Zidisha\'s lenders in funding loans is to improve the lives of these entrepreneurs, and not to make a profitable financial investment. Lending to entrepreneurs through Zidisha involves a meaningful risk of loss of your principal lent. In addition, you are very likely to lose money in real terms on any loan you fund, even if it is repaid by the borrower, as a result of currency exchange rate changes, PayPal fees applied to uploading credit to your lender account, inflation and other factors affecting the value of principal and interest payments made by a borrower. Accordingly, we recommend that you consider lending through Zidisha to be a philanthropic activity, and you should not lend more money through Zidisha than you are prepared to lose.</p>
