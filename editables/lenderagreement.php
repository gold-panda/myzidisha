<p>Via our website, www.zidisha.org, Zidisha matches its funding participants (to whom we refer as "lenders") with prospective borrowers, who are disadvantaged individuals in low-income countries. Zidisha works to improve access to affordable business financing for disadvantaged entrepreneurs by providing a website that allows lenders and borrowers to interact. Using our website, borrowers make available information about themselves and their businesses to allow each lender to choose which borrowers receive the funds that lender provides. </p>

	<p>The loans offered through Zidisha are unsecured and bear high risk of non-repayment.  In addition, Zidisha is not an investment broker and cannot enter into any obligation to return all or a portion of the funds provided by any lender.  Accordingly, participating in loans through Zidisha is intended to be a philanthropic rather than an investment activity. Website users should lend only amounts that they can afford to lose.</p>

	<p>Zidisha is a nonprofit organization responsible only for maintaining the Zidisha.org website. Zidisha is not a financial institution, and is not responsible for assessing credit risk of borrowers, enforcing repayment, or guaranteeing repayment of loans posted on its website. Lenders participate in the loans provided to Zidisha borrowers at the lenders\' own risk, based on their own assessment of prospective borrowers\' profiles posted on the site.</p>

	<p>Lenders accept the risk of loss in whole or in part of funds lent to Zidisha borrowers. Risks include but are not limited to political and economic instability, currency fluctuations, and the unpredictability inherent in entrepreneurial endeavors. </p>

	<h4>By using the Zidisha website, you hereby understand and agree to the following:</h4>

	<p>1.  Zidisha is not a bank or other financial institution or investment adviser, broker or dealer. As such, Zidisha can make no guarantee or representation that funds lent through its website will be repaid to lenders, regardless of whether the loans financed with lender funds are repaid to Zidisha.  Any cash payouts to lenders are promotional gifts offered solely at Zidisha\'s discretion.</p>

	<p>2.  Zidisha is not responsible or liable for any incorrect information posted on its website, or for losses or damages resulting from such information.  Other than personal details and repayment performance for any previous Zidisha loans, neither Zidisha nor any of the local financial institutions or credit bureaus with which Zidisha works has verified any of the information that borrowers post on Zidisha\'s website.  Zidisha is not responsible for the accuracy of any such information.</p>

	<p>3.  Loans posted for financing through the Zidisha website are unsecured and bear high risk of non-repayment.  Zidisha is not responsible for any financial losses resulting from use of its website.</p>

	<p>4.  Zidisha is a small nonprofit organization whose role is limited to providing and managing the Zidisha.org website.  Zidisha is under no obligation to provide loan repayment collection services for loans in arrears, or to provide reports on the status of outstanding loans.</p>

	<p>5. Zidisha allows borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties to modify their repayment schedules within the parameters set by Zidisha at the borrowers\' own initiative.  Borrowers may modify their repayment schedules without the consent of lenders.  Modification of repayment schedules may result in a longer repayment period than posted in borrowers\' original loan applications.</p>  

	<p>6.  Loan amounts are fixed in local currency at the time of disbursement.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may cause reductions in the dollar values of the loans over the course of the repayment period, causing lenders to lose money even if the loan is fully repaid.</p>
	
	<p>7.  Lenders residing outside the United States may only withdraw funds from their Zidisha accounts via PayPal. Lenders residing outside the United States who are not able to receive PayPal transfers will not be able to withdraw funds from their lender accounts.</p>
	
	<p>8.  Funds uploads to Zidisha lender accounts should not be treated as tax-deductible charitable contributions.</p>  

	<p>9.  It is the responsibility of website users to report and pay any applicable taxes on any cash payouts received from Zidisha.</p>

	<p>10.  In the event that a lender does not log in to his or her lender account for over one year, Zidisha will attempt to contact the aforementioned lender using the email address registered with his or her lender account. If Zidisha does not receive a response from the lender within one month from the date of the first contact attempt, the balance of lender funds that have been credited to that account will convert to an unrestricted donation to Zidisha.  Lenders whose expired accounts have converted to donations may reverse this conversion at any time by sending a written or email request to Zidisha.  Upon receipt of such a request, Zidisha will return the lender balance that had been converted to a donation to the lender.</p> 


	<p>This Terms of Use Agreement is governed by the laws of the state of Virginia, USA. The Agreement will remain in effect as long as you use the Zidisha website, are participating in any outstanding loan or have any amount credited to your funded balance with Zidisha.</p>

	<h4>Important Note:</h4>

	<p>Zidisha is a nonprofit organization engaged in the facilitation of microfinance lending to low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries. Zidisha\'s primary purpose is to provide financial aid in the form of loans. Zidisha believes that its lending model fosters a sense of responsibility and success for borrowers who repay their loans. The principal purpose of Zidisha\'s lenders in funding loans is to improve the lives of these entrepreneurs, and not to make a profitable financial investment. Lending to entrepreneurs through Zidisha involves a meaningful risk of loss of your principal lent. In addition, you are very likely to lose money in real terms on any loan you fund, even if it is repaid by the borrower, as a result of currency exchange rate changes, PayPal fees applied to uploading credit to your lender account, inflation and other factors affecting the value of principal and interest payments made by a borrower. Accordingly, we recommend that you consider lending through Zidisha to be a philanthropic activity, and you should not lend more money through Zidisha than you are prepared to lose.</p>
