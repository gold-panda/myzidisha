				<h4>Paul Musembi, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Mugaa village, Kenya</h4>
 
				<p>I am very happy that I am currently about to settle my loan... just to show you how much Zidisha has helped me, I am one of the most affected by the 2007 post-election violence in Kenya, our home was looted and cattle raiders escaped with our animals, we were left stranded and I was unable to pursue my [university] degree course... but  currently I have managed to buy a plot worth 30,000 Kenya Shillings and I am planning how I will build a house and later further my studies... but currently i am planning to do my best in business and never blame who ever triggered the election violence. God is great that after getting a job at Mugaa Secondary School I was introduced to Zidisha... with good plans I am certain that Zidisha can make me do wonders due to its low loan interest rates... may God bless you and may you live to blow 10001 candles.</p>

				<h4>Ndeye Bineta Sarr, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Dakar, Senegal</h4>

				<p>I am very satisfied with the loan from Zidisha. Since I received my loan, I have become more independent and more productive...  the loan helped me a lot because now I can handle more orders. Before I couldn\'t take more than three orders at a time, now I can handle more than 10 and probably more in the future... I am able to work full-time and provide for my household without asking anyone else for help. I believe now that everyone has the possibility to find work, if they know what to do and where to seek the resources they need. I believe that there are people who genuinely want to help poor people in the world, and that we all have the opportunity to advance ourselves and make a success of our life.</p>

				<h4>John Mopel Napais, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Narok, Kenya</h4>

				<p>Now I have plenty of stock that meets my customers demand; this was not possible without your help... from the profit generated in the last one month I\'m ploughing three acre of maize to feed my poshomill. My family enjoys my festive season because I have something to cater for what they may require. Enjoy your Christmas.</p>

				<h4>David Maina, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Mugaa village, Kenya</h4>

				<p>I want to register my appreciation to Zidisha team for not only supporting my business but also positively impacting into my family\'s welfare. Through Zidisha I have able to scale up my business activities, earned more income which translates to better living standard for my family and purchase a better motorbike for my business. I sold one which was not up to the services my business demands now. Besides I was able to formalize ownership of two plots of land that had remained without title deeds for three years since i bought them. Kudos Zidisha team...</p>

				<h4>Our√®ye Faye, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Dakar, Senegal</h4>

				<p>All my children go to private school. I work for the future of my children. Reading and writing is a right and duty all parents must ensure for their children. I work to help my children because I know that if I had the same opportunities they have I would have succeeded as an engineer or a mechanic. I would like to thank you again. If all lenders were like you, Africa would develop, because the profits I gain from this loan go to my children\'s education, and our children are the ones who will develop Africa.</p>

				<h4>Alice Wakonyo, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Mugaa, Kenya</h4>  

				<p>I am so grateful for your assistance that I really don\'t know how to reward you. You came to my life when I was so desperate, frustrated and I was feeling to have been finished. Following the post-election violence in 2007 and 2008, people were displaced and run away with the debt, the stock left was looted. After I came joinly with Zidisha my life had been relieved. I followed the procedures and after a period of two months I was with my 50,000 Kenya Shillings that I am almost to clear. Comes as a surprise because my sales had been so down due to the shortage of enough varieties of goods. The first thing was to change motorbike from a bicycle to make work easier. It has helped a lot and I have regained my lost customers and also cash in has gone up. I have been happy with the way I have been paying my loan because it\'s with favorable interest... Once again to you Zidisha you have been my strength and my hope. I love you and may God bless you.</p>

				<h4>Khadijatou Badji, Zidisha Borrower<br/>Dakar, Senegal</h4>

				<p>This loan has really helped me to carry out an exciting activity, exciting because with selling products, I succeed in helping many people with their health, as well as with their well-being and their beauty, and also am able to support myself. Thanks to the profits I earn, I manage to take care of my daughter and also help my family whenever I can. And I do not stop talking about Zidisha to my friends, one of them was a beneficiary and there are others who are interested. Long live Zidisha, because you are the best who help people who want to work without imposing arbitrary conditions. One more time, I cannot thank you enough for all that you have done for me. Thanks to your generosity, I have left the cadre of the unemployed by leading an exciting activity that I love. Thank you Zidisha.</p>
