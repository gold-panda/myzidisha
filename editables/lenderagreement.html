<p class="p1"><b>&lt;strong&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/strong&gt;</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;Via our website, www.zidisha.org, Zidisha matches its funding participants (to whom we refer as "lenders") with prospective borrowers, who are disadvantaged individuals in low-income countries. Zidisha works to improve access to affordable business financing for disadvantaged entrepreneurs by providing a website that allows lenders and borrowers to interact. Using our website, borrowers make available information about themselves and their businesses to allow each lender to choose which borrowers receive the funds that lender provides. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;The loans offered through Zidisha are unsecured and bear high risk of non-repayment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, Zidisha is not an investment broker and cannot enter into any obligation to return all or a portion of the funds provided by any lender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Accordingly, participating in loans through Zidisha is intended to be a philanthropic rather than an investment activity. Website users should lend only amounts that they can afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;Zidisha is a nonprofit organization responsible only for maintaining the Zidisha.org website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zidisha is not a financial institution, and is not responsible for assessing credit risk of borrowers, collecting repayment or guaranteeing repayment of loans posted on its website. Lenders participate in the loans provided by to Zidisha borrowers at the lenders\' own risk, based on their own assessment of prospective borrowers\' profiles posted on the site.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;Lenders accept the risk of loss in whole or in part of funds lent to Zidisha borrowers. Risks include but are not limited to political and economic instability, currency fluctuations, and the unpredictability inherent in entrepreneurial endeavors. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;h4&gt;By using the Zidisha website, you hereby understand and agree to the following:&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zidisha is not a bank or other financial institution or investment adviser, broker or dealer. As such, Zidisha can make no guarantee or representation that funds lent through its website will be repaid to lenders, regardless of whether the loans financed with lender funds are repaid to Zidisha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any cash payouts to lenders are promotional gifts offered solely at Zidisha\'s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zidisha is not responsible or liable for any incorrect information posted on its website, or for losses or damages resulting from such information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other than personal details and repayment performance for any previous Zidisha loans, neither Zidisha nor any of the local financial institutions or credit bureaus with which Zidisha works has verified any of the information that borrowers post on Zidisha\'s website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zidisha is not responsible for the accuracy of any such information.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;5. Zidisha allows borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties to modify their repayment schedules within the parameters set by Zidisha at the borrowers\' own initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Borrowers may modify their repayment schedules without the consent of lenders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Modification of repayment schedules may result in a longer repayment period than posted in borrowers\' original loan applications.&lt;/p&gt; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Loan amounts are fixed in local currency at the time of disbursement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currency exchange rate fluctuations may cause reductions in the dollar values of the loans over the course of the repayment period, causing lenders to lose money even if the loan is fully repaid.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;7.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lenders residing outside the United States may only withdraw funds from their Zidisha accounts via PayPal. Lenders residing outside the United States who are not able to receive PayPal transfers will not be able to withdraw funds from their lender accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Funds uploads to Zidisha lender accounts should not be treated as tax-deductible charitable contributions.&lt;/p&gt; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;10.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the event that a lender does not log in to his or her lender account for over one year, Zidisha will attempt to contact the aforementioned lender using the email address registered with his or her lender account. If Zidisha does not receive a response from the lender within one month from the date of the first contact attempt, the balance of lender funds that have been credited to that account will convert to an unrestricted donation to Zidisha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lenders whose expired accounts have converted to donations may reverse this conversion at any time by sending a written or email request to Zidisha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Upon receipt of such a request, Zidisha will return the lender balance that had been converted to a donation to the lender.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;h4&gt;Important Note:&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>&lt;p&gt;Zidisha is a nonprofit organization engaged in the facilitation of microfinance lending to low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zidisha\'s primary purpose is to provide financial aid in the form of loans. Zidisha believes that its lending model fosters a sense of responsibility and success for borrowers who repay their loans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The principal purpose of Zidisha\'s lenders in funding loans is to help finance these entrepreneurs, and not to make a profitable investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lending to entrepreneurs through Zidisha involves a meaningful risk of loss of your principal lent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, you may not realize a profit on any loan you fund, even if it is repaid by the borrower, as a result of currency exchange rate changes and other factors affecting the value of principal and interest payments made by a borrower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Accordingly, you should not lend more money through Zidisha than you are prepared to lose.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
