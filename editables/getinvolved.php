<p><a name="1"></a><b>Bring Zidisha to Your Campus</b></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Want to be more involved with Zidisha at your school? Start a Zidisha Club! Pool together money and vote on a borrower to fund together. You can choose a new borrower to fund once a month or even once a week.</li>
<li>Become a Communications Associate or Client Relationship Manager Intern for the summer, or during the semester. Learn more about our internship program and check out current openings <a href="https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/intern.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Need a dorm-bonding activity? Get your dorm to fund a borrower together and see how their business grows. </li></ul><br>
<br>
<p><a name="2"></a><b>Zidisha for Teachers</b></p>
<p>French</p>
<ul>
	<li>Let your students interact and write to a fluent French speaker on the other side of the globe. Have each student choose a Zidisha entrepreneur in a francophone country to keep a dialogue with, or pick one borrower as a class.</li>
	<li>Arrange to Skype with the borrower in French during class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economics</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about interest rates and the time value of money through lending to a borrower.</li>
<li>Choose a borrower for your classroom and discuss how your borrower can make his or her  business more efficient.</li>
<li>Learn about supply and demand and why your borrower\'s business will be successful. For example, why would sheep farming be especially lucrative during holidays where Senegalese households traditionally sacrifice a sheep?</li>
</ul>
<p>Art</p>
<ul>
<li>Many Zidisha borrowers are artists. Look at the different artwork they do, ask them for a quick lesson, and then do that art project in your classroom. You can send a picture of the finished projects back to the borrower!</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainability</p>
<ul>
<li>	Use money from deposited cans and bottles to upload a loan from your classroom.</li>
<li>Learn how a borrower runs his business. How can he or she make it more sustainable? How is his business more sustainable than businesses in your country?</li>
<li>Has he or she noticed a difference in his or her business because of climate change?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="3"></a><b>Ideas for Everyone</b></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Throw a party and feel good about it. Ask guests to lend five dollars each, then have everyone vote on a borrower to fund.</li>
<li>Tell your co-workers about Zidisha! Inspire the office to fund a member.</li>
<li>Give your family a vacation they will never forget and take a trip across the world to meet a Zidisha entrepreneur in person.</li></ul>
