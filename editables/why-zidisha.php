$lang['why-zidisha']['desc']='<h1>Why Support Entrepreneurs Through Peer-to-Peer Microfinance Lending?</h1>
		
		<p>

Entrepreneurs in developing nations face a difficult problem: With average microfinance interest rates upwards of 40% or more, the high cost of financial services for the poor keeps them from growing their earnings enough to improve their families\' standards of living.</p> 
<p>
You can change that by becoming a lender. When you support microfinance through social investments in a Zidisha entrepreneur, you not only fund a microfinance project, but you also fight poverty in that entrepreneur\'s family and community.
</p> 
			<h4>Direct Peer-to-Peer Microlending</h4>
			<p>Unlike other internet microfinance websites that simply allow web users to fund microfinance programs, we offer the ability to interact directly with the entrepreneurs. Lenders can post questions and comments, while borrowers share the progress of their micro investments and let lenders know about the impact that their microfinance investing provides.</p><br/><br/>

		<h4>Zidisha Offers Dramatically Lower Microfinance Interest Rates to the Entrepreneurs</h4>
		
		<p>While other microfinance services charge borrowers interest rates upwards of 40% or more, our direct peer-to-peer microlending model reduces the cost of Zidisha loans to just a fraction of this. The lower microfinance interest rates translate into larger profits for the entrepreneurs - profits that go directly towards the well-being of their families and their communities.</p><br/><br/>

			<h4 class="type14">Important Legal Notice</h4>
			<p class="type10">Zidisha is a nonprofit organization engaged in the facilitation of microfinance lending to low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries. Zidisha\'s primary purpose is to provide financial aid in the form of loans. Zidisha believes that its lending model fosters a sense of responsibility and success for borrowers who repay their loans. The principal purpose of Zidisha\'s lenders in funding loans is to improve the lives of these entrepreneurs, and not to make a profitable financial investment. Lending to entrepreneurs through Zidisha involves a meaningful risk of loss of your principal lent. In addition, you are very likely to lose money in real terms on any loan you fund, even if it is repaid by the borrower, as a result of currency exchange rate changes, PayPal fees applied to uploading credit to your lender account, inflation and other factors affecting the value of principal and interest payments made by a borrower. Accordingly, we recommend that you consider lending through Zidisha to be a philanthropic activity, and you should not lend more money through Zidisha than you are prepared to lose.</p>
