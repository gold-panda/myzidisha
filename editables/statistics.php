The repayment rate is therefore calculated as the dollar volume of principal that has been repaid six months after the end of its loan term, divided by the total dollar volume of principal whose loan term has expired six months ago or more.  <br/><br/>Note: As this definition applies only to ended loans, a more meaningful indicator of the principal risk of active loans is the percentage of active loans that are paying back late, displayed below.';
