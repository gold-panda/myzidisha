				Most people in wealthy countries think of interest rates as an Annual Percentage Rate, or an Annual Effective Rate (APR/AER). In microfinance terms, this is referred to as a "declining balance interest rate." As the loan capital is repaid throughout the life of the loan, the interest charged per month declines accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many developing countries use an alternative method of calculating interest, called a "flat interest rate." In a flat interest rate, the interest rate per month is a fixed percentage of the orignal loan amount, regardless of the fact that the loan capital is declining each month. Some confusion may arise when comparing a flat rate with a declining balance rate.

			</p>

				<strong>The difference is best illustrated with an example:</strong><br/><br/>
				If I borrow $100 to repay over ten months with an interest rate of 2% per month, with a flat interest loan I repay 2% x $100 x 10 months = $20. Even though I pay $10 of my loan balance each month, so my monthly balance declines from $100 to $90 to $80 etc., I still pay $2 in interest each month. I pay $10 + $2 = $12 each and every month. $12 x 10 months = $120. This is the $100 I borrowed, plus $20 in interest.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a declining balance interest rate, I pay 2% per month depending on the capital I have outstanding in that month. In the first month I had $100, so I pay $2 in interest. At the end of the month I pay $10 of capital and $2 for interest during that month. My balance is now $90. At the end of the second month I also pay $10 of capital, but only $90 x 2% = $1.80 in interest, because I was only borrowing $90 that month. In the third month I will pay $80 x 2% = $1.60 in interest, plus $10 in capital = $11.60. In the final month, I will only pay $10 x 2% = $0.20. My total interest will be $2 + $1.80 + 1.60 etc. which is $11 - rouhgly half what I would pay for a flat interest loan.

				If we think in APR terms, we may underestimate the total interest cost to a borrower when we see an interest rate of "5% per year flat." We may think that this is equivalent to an APR rate of 5%, whereas in fact a flat rate of 5% is equivalent to an APR rate of approximately double this: 10%.
			</p>
			<p>
				But if the choice is between 10% declining balance interest or 5% flat interest, these are approximately the same in terms of the total interest expense, and it may be easier to pay 5% flat so I know that each month I have to pay the same fixed amounts of loan principal and interest. This is why many borrowers prefer the simplicity of flat interest rates. 

			</p>
			<p>
				So which interest rate calculation method is better? The answer is that each method has advantages and disadvantages. But we have to be aware that there is a big difference between these two methods of calculating interest.<br/><br/>
				When translating from one to the other it is safe to make the following approximation:<br/><br/>
				To convert a flat interest rate to a declining interest rate, double the rate.
				<br/>
				So, if a Zidisha loan's interest rate is "5% flat", what is the equivalent annual declining balance interest rate?<br/><br/>
				Answer: approximately 10%.
