Host file config
	127.0.0.1 	zidisha.dev
	127.0.0.1 	www.zidisha.dev

Vhost config
	Example virtual host:

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
		DocumentRoot "C:/wamp/www/zidisha"
		ServerName zidisha.dev
		ServerAlias www.zidisha.dev *.zidisha.dev
		ErrorLog "logs/zidisha-errors.log"
		CustomLog "logs/zidisha-access.log" common
		<directory "C:/wamp/www/zidisha">
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
			AllowOverride All
			Order Allow,Deny
			Allow from All
		</directory>
			SetEnv ENV_NAME production
			SetEnv ENV_DB_USER root
			SetEnv ENV_DB_PASS 
			SetEnv ENV_SITE_URL /
			SetEnv ENV_FULL_PATH C:/wamp/www/zidisha/
			SetEnv ENV_ROOT_PATH C:/wamp/www/zidisha/
			SetEnv ENV_COOKIE_SECURE true
			SetEnv ENV_SITE_URL http://zidisha.dev/
	</VirtualHost>

	The ENV_FULL_PATH and ENV_ROOT_PATH must point to the web root of the project and have a trailing slash!
	ENV_DB_USER and ENV_DB_PASS contain the database credentials

	ENV_SITE_URL must contain the full web base url for the site



.htaccess config
	the .htaccess file has been gitignored. It is now in .htaccess-template, which must be copied over to .htaccess and set according to the server.
	In most cases it would be best to comment out:
	
	#AuthName "Zidisha Site"
	#AuthUserFile "/home4/semfundc/.htpasswds/public_html/zidisha/passwd"

	AND

	#RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !^443$
	#RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.zidisha.dev/$1 [L,R] 
	#RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} ^https://www.zidisha.dev(\/?)$
	#RewriteRule (.*) https://www.zidisha.dev/en/$1 [R=302,L]

	AND change the website domain - zidisha.DOMAIN

Database config
	/dev/semfundc_zidisha.sql contains the structure for the database
	/dev/semfundc_zidisha_dev.sql contains a database with meaningful data

Local links
	In order for the local links to work, when running the site on a different domain, everywhere the hardcoded https://www.zidisha.org/ must be replaced with the SITE_URL constant

	This can be seen here:
	/editables/about.php

Constants file:
	/lib/constant_local.php is the local version of /lib/constant.php
	However IMO it is not needed to have two sepparate files.
	Now the constant.php is .gitignored and its content is in constant-template.php
	According to the environment the site is running in, every developer must cp constant-tempalte.php to constant.php and set their personal settings there.

Logfiles:
	The site logfile dir is zidisha_contents\logs, but it is .gitignored, so it should be created locally for every env
